# MLF - HW3 (Programming Part)

##### By: Wu-Jun Pei (B06902029)

### Source Code for Problem 4 and 5

##### Tree for the directory

```
b06902029/
├── Prob4.py
└── README.md

0 directories, 2 files
```

##### How to execute my code

-   The simplest way to run the code and get the result.

    ```
    python3 Prob4.py
    ```

-   Or you want to change the number of iterations (for example, $10000$)

    ```
    python3 Prob4.py [number of iterations]
    ```

This python code will generate two figures and one text file in the directory `ExpResult` in the same directory.

-   `Ein_[number of iterations].png`, the figure for *Problem 4*
-   `Eout_[number of iterations].png` , the figure for *Problem 5*
-   `Result_[number of iterations]`, the result (including $E_{in}$ and $E_{out}$ for both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

##### My python environment

-   `Python 3.7.0`
-   `numpy 1.15.3`
-   `matplotlib 3.0.0`
