### 7. 

The python code is named `Prob_7.py` in the same directory.

##### Environment:

- `Python 3.7.0`
- `matplotlib 3.0.0`
- `numpy 1.15.3`

##### How to run my code?

`python3 Prob_7.py < hw1_7_train.dat`

After that, you should be able to see the result histogram (perhaps the same as the one named `result.png`).
