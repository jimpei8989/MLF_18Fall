# MLF - HW2 (Programming Part)

### Problem 7 (Programming Part)

The directory should looks like

```
b06902029
├── Prob7.py
└── README.md
```

#### How to execute it?

Simply `python3 Prob7.py`. The histogram produced is not likely to be exactly the same one as the one provided in my work because the way I generate $X$'s is a random way.

#### My environment

- `Python 3.7.0`
- `numpy 1.15.3`
- `matplotlib 3.0.0`
